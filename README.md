# Linked List Project

This project is a C++ implementation of **singly linked lists**, including:

- Safe insertions and deletions
- Merging two sorted linked lists
- Tracking the operation complexity with a global counter (`opCount`)
- Reporting statistics after each major action

## File Name

Main source file: `linkedmerge.cpp`

## Features

- Prevents duplicate insertions
- Clean deletion with user feedback
- Sorted merge functionality
- Real-time stats: insert, delete, merge, opCount

## Files

- `linkedmerge.cpp`: Main C++ source file for the linked list implementation

## How to Compile & Run (optional)

```bash
g++ linkedmerge.cpp -o linkedmerge
./linkedmerge
